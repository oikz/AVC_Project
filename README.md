# Due Dates:
* Final Code Due 19th June
* Group Log/Report Due 24th June
* Individual Log based on commit messages throughout
* Wiki Discussion of progress due 12th and 19th June


# Milestones:
## Complete Plan & Github Setup - Due Thursday 4th June
*    Tasks:
*    Setup Github repo and invite everyone
*    Push given files to github and have everyone clone/pull files
*    (Optional) Use a CLion compatible version of the project
*    Discuss plan with team and organise due dates etc
*    Organise roles etc
*    Plan further meetings

## Core Code/Testing            - Due Thursday 11th June
*    Tasks:
*    Split workload
*    Extract array of colours from image
*    Figure out how the robot needs to respond
*    Sort out the motors and how to make the robot turn to correct itself
*    Test on the course

## Completion Code/Testing      - Due Shortly after Core Code
*    Figure out how to make robot work with two lines
*    i.e. have robot make two arrays and correct its direction from that
*    Build on Core Code
    
## Challenge Code/Testing       - Due Thursday 18th June
*    Make robot able to pathfind based on presence of red outline of the course 
*    Potentially make it always turn left in the case of multiple choices?

## Reflection                   - Due Wednesday 24th June
* Report should include following sections:
*    Task which your code solved
*    Approach your team took to solve the task: programming language, OS, hardware. Imagine that it was your choice.
*    Architecture - how your code is structured
*    Solution - what final version of software is capable of doing. Subsections: Image Processing and Motor Control. Algorithms you used.
*    Team dynamic how well team worked together and is team capable of doing bigger project
*    State Of The Art Review of autonomous driving software. Should include at least five references. Does not have to be very deep.
*    To do how your code can be adapted to autonomous driving, what should be added
*    Recommendations Go - no go for bigger project. 




# Meeting Times:
